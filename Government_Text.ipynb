      "AB 193 (Cervantes) creates the Zero-Emission Assurance Project, which will provide a rebate for the purchase of a replacement battery or fuel cell component for a used zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) for qualified consumers. This will build consumer confidence in the purchase of a used zero emission vehicle by providing additional assurance that replacement of a battery or fuel cell component will not impose a cost burden on low-income consumers.\n",
      "AB 2006 (Eggman) makes permanent an existing agricultural worker vanpool program, which will result in zero-emission and hybrid vans taking passenger vehicles off the road in communities most impacted by California’s poor air quality.\n",
      "AB 2127 (Ting) supports the state’s goal of achieving 5 million ZEVs on the road by 2030 by affirming the California Energy Commission’s authority to assess the need for charging infrastructure to support adoption of zero-emission vehicles, including freight and off‑road vehicles.\n",
      "AB 2885 (Rodriguez) continues the legislative priority of ensuring that California’s incentive programs serve all communities, by extending the requirement that the California Air Resources Board (CARB) conduct outreach to low-income households and communities as part of the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project. The bill also requires CARB to continue to prioritize rebates to low-income applicants until Jan 1, 2022.\n",
      "SB 957 (Lara) facilitates further growth of the used zero-emission vehicle market by opening carpool lanes to low-income drivers of used clean air vehicles.\n",
      "SB 1000 (Lara) requires the state to assess whether vehicle-charging infrastructure is sufficient to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles, and ensures that both plug-in electric vehicles and zero-emission vehicles have equal access to charging infrastructure. By increasing accessibility to electric vehicle charging infrastructure and managing the costs of electricity, SB 1000 will support the transportation electrification needed to meet California’s greenhouse gas and clean air goals.\n",
      "SB 1014 (Skinner) directs the state to develop emissions reduction targets for ride-hailing services, which represent a growing element of California’s transportation sector. This bill will help ensure that work the Governor has set into motion to increase adoption of zero-emission vehicles in public and private fleets throughout the state continues.\n",
      "SB 1403 (Lara) ensures that the state’s incentive dollars are invested strategically and are incentivizing the adoption of zero and near-zero emission heavy duty vehicles and equipment, including school buses. The bill requires CARB to develop three-year investment plans for these vehicles starting in 2019. It is critical that investments are prioritized – demand for the state’s incentive programs that support zero and near-zero emission heavy-duty vehicles and equipment vastly outstrips the resources available.\n",
      "AB 2195 (Chau) will help the public access information regarding the greenhouse gas emissions from gas leakage and flaring resulting from natural gas imported into and consumed in California.\n",
      "AB 2564 (Rodriguez) will help protect communities from the increased pollution associated with glider kits. With pending federal threats regarding leniencies related to glider kits, this bill sets a high, non-negotiable penalty amount for operating non-compliant glider kits in the state. Diesel particulate matter emissions from glider kits can be up to 450 times higher than emissions from trucks that are complying with the state’s regulations. This bill sends a strong message that dirty glider kits are not welcome in California.\n",
      "AB 3232 (Friedman) directs state agencies to work together to assess what actions should be taken to reduce emissions from the state’s residential and commercial buildings, recognizing the important work needed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector.\n",
      "SB 720 (Allen) builds upon California’s commitment to environmental literacy by updating CalRecycle’s environmental principles and concepts to formally include climate change and ensures that the Instructional Quality Commission integrates these environmental principles into future curriculum.\n",
      "SB 1013 (Lara) in the face of federal reversals, this bill provides a critical backstop to ensure California does not backslide on emissions of hydrofluorocarbons and achieves its short-lived climate pollutant reduction goals. The bill also creates the Fluorinated Gases Emission Reduction Incentive Program to promote the adoption of low‑global warming potential refrigerants.\n",
      "SB 1016 (Allen) prohibits homeowner associations from unreasonably restricting an owner’s ability to install or use an electric vehicle time-of-use meter and modifies current liability policies.\n",
      "SB 1072 (Leyva) establishes a regional climate collaborative program to assist under‑resourced communities with accessing statewide public and other grant money for climate change mitigation and adaptation‑related projects. The bill also requires the Strategic Growth Council to develop technical assistance best practices that state agencies may use and identify state grants that could benefit from technical assistance best practices.\n",
      "SB 1477 (Stern) The quantity of greenhouse gas emissions associated with buildings is second only to greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. This bill establishes two incentive programs aimed at reducing emissions from buildings – one to provide financial incentives for the deployment of near-zero emission building technologies and a second to incentivize the installment of low‑emission space and water heating equipment for new and existing buildings.\n",
